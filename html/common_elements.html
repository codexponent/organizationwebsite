				<h2>Question and Answers</h2>
				<p>a) What is a markup?</p>
				<p>Ans: Markup refers to the sequence of characters 
				   or other symbols that you insert at certain places in a text or word processing file
 				   to indicate how the file should look when it is printed or displayed or to describe
 				   the document's logical structure.</p>
				<p>b) What is hypertext and hypermedia?</p>
				<p>Ans: Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts.</p>
				<p>Hypermedia is the generalization of hypertext to include other kinds of media: 
				   images, audio clips and video clips are typically supported in addition to text.Surfing the web is made possible by hyperlinks which allows access to other documents on the web. <br>
				   example: <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards">Click here to visit the standards page at the W3C</a> </p>
				<p>c) What is a doctype and why is it important to include it in every HTML document?</p>
				<p>Ans: Doctype is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.Doctype     declaration specifies the version of HTML and it should always be included 
				   as the first line of code. Browsers will attempt to render documents without a doctype 
				   with their so called "quirck mode" with possible unexpected results.</p>

				<p>Ans: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the web documents.</p>

				   For example:br, link, img, area, base, input, meta, etc.</p>
				<p>g) What is XML and why is it important to web developers?</p>
				<p>Ans: XML is a software and hardware independent tool for storing and transporting data. XML is a general purpose markup language with stricter syntax rules than HTML.</p>
				<p>It is important because it is essential for well structured documents that are easier to 
				   develop and maintain.XML allows the flexible development of user-defined document types.</p>
				<p>h)Describe 4 XML rules?</p>
				<p>Ans: The XML rules are:<br>
				   1.Elements must be properly nested.<br> 
				   2.Elements must have a start and end tag.<br> 
				   3.Element names are case-sensitive.<br>
				   4.Attribute values must be enclosed in double quotation marks.<br></p>
				<p>i) What is the difference bwtween a "well-formed" and a valid web document?</p>
				<p>Ans: Validators are simple to use and it also provides useful feedback for updating your document to be valid according to a particular standard specification.</p>
				<p> Well formdness is all about grammer or rules. The rules are in fact the XML set of rules
 				   for encoding documents in machine readable form. The X in XHTML, comes from the first HTML
				   specification implemented using XML syntax.</p>
